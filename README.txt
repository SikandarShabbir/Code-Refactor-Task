Generic coding and applications development practices:

You can make use of the SOLID principles to develop an application with better code management and coding standards with the help of following principles:
S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class/function should have only one responsibility. It means that a class should have a single responsibility or purpose.
O — Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. It means that you should be able to add new functionality or behaviors to a class without modifying its existing code.
L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
A subclass should be substitutable for its parent class. It guarantees that subclasses and their base classes can be used interchangeably without generating any unexpected behaviour.
I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
A client should not be forced to depend on methods that it does not use. This principle emphasizes the segregation of interfaces into smaller, more specific ones. It guarantees that subclasses and their base classes can be used interchangeably without generating any unexpected behaviour.
D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
It emphasises the use of interfaces or abstract classes to specify dependencies and encourages loose coupling between classes.

You can utilize PSR standards to make nature of code streamline.
Make use of static analysis tools find bugs before the code execution.
Make use of DRY(Don't repeat yourself) concept while developing code.

Regarding Application development following points should be in mind to develop a robust and large-scale application:

Scalable Architecture:
Use microservices architecture, distributed systems, and horizontal scaling techniques to ensure scalability.

Optimized Database Design:
Design an optimized database schema with proper indexing, partitioning, and sharding strategies to handle large datasets efficiently.

Caching Strategies:
Implement caching mechanisms to reduce database load and improve performance. Use in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached to store frequently accessed data.

Asynchronous Processing:
Offload time-consuming tasks to background jobs or queues using asynchronous processing.

Load Balancing:
Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or instances to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Performance Optimization:
Write efficient and optimized code/queries to minimize resource consumption and improve performance.

Monitoring and Analytics:
Implement monitoring and analytics tools to track application performance, user behavior, and system health.

Security Best Practices:
Use encryption, authentication, authorization, and security headers to secure the application.

Automated Testing:
Implement automated testing practices, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests, to ensure code quality, reliability, and scalability.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):
Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, testing, and deployment process.

Documentation and Code Comments:
Maintain comprehensive documentation and code comments to facilitate collaboration, code review, and future maintenance.

Regarding Application code:
The provided code is well planned, organized, and used repository design pattern.
Further I have added the comments to each line of the provided files where needed.
I have updated the BookingController file code and BookingRepository code upto updateJob() method, please see the commit of refactored code.
Hope its enough to access my thoughts and skillset regarding application plan from scratch and development as well.
